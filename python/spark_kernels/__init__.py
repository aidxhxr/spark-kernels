"""spark-kernels: hand-written CUDA kernels for LLM inference on Blackwell RTX 5090 (sm_120).

Also builds for the NVIDIA DGX Spark (GB10, sm_121) with TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="12.1".

Ops (all run on the current CUDA stream, all accept float32 or bfloat16 unless noted):

    rmsnorm(x, w, eps=1e-6, variant=-1)      RMSNorm over the last dim
    add_rmsnorm_(x, resid, w, eps=1e-6)      resid += x; return rmsnorm(resid)  (bf16, in place)
    swiglu(gate, up, variant=-1)             silu(gate) * up
    softmax(x, variant=-1)                   softmax over the last dim, fp32 math
    sgemm(a, b, variant=-1)                  fp32 GEMM (a @ b)
    hgemm(a, b, variant=-1)                  bf16 tensor-core GEMM (a @ b), fp32 accumulate
    num_variants(name)                       how many implementations exist for `name`

`variant` selects a rung on the optimization ladder described in docs/DESIGN.md; -1 picks
the fastest one that accepts the input (see ops.py for the two ladders where that is not the
top rung). `spark_kernels.reference` holds plain-PyTorch implementations used by tests.
