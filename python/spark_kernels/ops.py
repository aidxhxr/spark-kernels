"""Thin Python wrappers over the compiled extension (spark_kernels._C).

All validation and dispatch happens in python/csrc/bindings.cpp: row-wise ops flatten every
leading dim into `rows`, and the output always has the input's shape and dtype. These wrappers
exist for the docstrings and type hints.

`variant=-1` (the default) runs the fastest implementation that accepts the input. Two
ladders have a top rung with extra requirements, and there the default steps down one rung
instead of failing: `swiglu` needs 16-byte aligned storage for its vectorized variant, and
`hgemm` variant 2 needs M, N multiples of 128 and K a multiple of 32. An explicit variant is
never substituted; it raises ValueError if it cannot take the input.
